# ECG Arrhythmia Diagnosis Using Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of the **Foundation of Machine Learning**
course at IIT Kharagpur.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to automatically classify ECG heartbeat segments
into multiple arrhythmia categories using machine learning and deep learning
models.

## Dataset
- MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database
- Single-lead ECG signals sampled at 360 Hz
- Beat-level segmentation using R-peak detection

## Models Implemented
- Simple 1D CNN
- BiLSTM
- ResNet1D-Lite

## Results
The models achieved strong classification performance, with:
- Validation accuracy up to ~98%
- High Macro F1-scores, indicating balanced performance across classes
